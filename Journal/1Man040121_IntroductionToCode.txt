Agenda for today:
	Get code to compile
	Get code to work in python
	Get code to compile Andreas' example given on outlook.

Notes for today:
	Code took longer to get to work than expected.
	Especially GLFW is giving me a hard time - annoying.
	To get a better idea of how compiling and linking works, i will try to write a small program,
	utilizing GLFW.

Outcome of today:
	Got some idea of what to do in the 3-week and bachelor
